Hello, and welcome to the CobaltRetroTech GitHub Repository! I am interested in Linux and Python. 
I plan on using this Repo to store setup scripts for Linux distros and Python projects as I work on learning Python.
My primary CPU architecture is x86-64 but I also have a PPC iMac and mobile ARM devices.

I prefer Linux, but I do run all three major platforms, Windows MacOS and Linux.
